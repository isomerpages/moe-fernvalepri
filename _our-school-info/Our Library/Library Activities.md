#### **Drop Everything and Read (D.E.A.R.) Programme**

All students are required to read an English or a Mother Tongue storybook daily from the time they arrive at their assembly areas in the morning till 7.30 a.m. Students can read any book of their choice during this time. Through this programme, we hope to cultivate a routine of self-directed and independent reading.

#### **Library Period**

During library period, students are involved in a variety of activities that will enable them to enrich themselves. Some of the activities are shared below.

* Classes are scheduled to visit the library on a weekly basis during their English lessons. During this period, students will have the opportunity to borrow English and Mother Tongue books as well as use the facilities provided in the library for reading related activities.
* Lessons are conducted to introduce various authors and a wide range of genres to our students. This allows them to learn about the background of the authors and their writing styles used in their books.
* In order to nurture independent learners and avid readers, sharing sessions are encouraged for students to share the stories they have read with their classmates.

#### **Assembly Programmes**
The school works closely with NLB to promote the joy of reading in the students. A representative from the NLB will conduct Story Sharing sessions during assembly for the students. NLB will also organize Mass Borrowing sessions in the school where books are brought from the National Library and booths are set up for students to borrow after which they will have to return it directly to the National Library. While Mass Borrowing sessions were temporarily stopped in the past few years, we aim to resume it soon.
