#### **Drop Everything and Read (D.E.A.R.) Programme**

All students are required to read an English or a Mother Tongue storybook daily from the time they arrive at their assembly areas in the morning till 7.30 a.m. Students can read any book of their choice during this time. Through this programme, we hope to cultivate a routine of self-directed and independent reading.

#### **Library Period**

During library period, students are involved in a variety of activities that will enable them to enrich themselves. Some of the activities are shared below.

* Classes are scheduled to visit the library on a weekly basis during their English lessons. During this period, students will have the opportunity to borrow English and Mother Tongue books as well as use the facilities provided in the library for reading related activities.
* Lessons are conducted to introduce various authors and a wide range of genres to our students. This allows them to learn about the background of the authors and their writing styles used in their books.
* In order to nurture independent learners and avid readers, sharing sessions are encouraged for students to share the stories they have read with their classmates.

#### **Assembly Programmes**
Our school maintains a strong partnership with the National Library Board (NLB) to actively promote a love of reading among our students. One of the key initiatives in this collaboration is the sharing of interesting and engaging stories during assembly sessions. NLB regularly conducts storytelling programmes as part of our assemblies, designed to captivate students' imaginations and encourage a lifelong passion for reading.

In addition to these enriching sessions led by NLB, our teachers also play an active role by dedicating specific assembly slots to share stories with our students. These storytelling sessions, whether conducted by NLB or our teachers, aim to foster curiosity, broaden students’ horizons, and build a vibrant reading culture within the school community.

#### **NLB Molly Bus**
The NLB Molly Bus, an initiative by the National Library Board (NLB), aims to promote reading and literacy among children. As a mobile library, Molly travels to schools, offering access to books and library services.

On 9 and 10 September 2024, the bus visited our school, giving our Primary 1 and 2 students the chance to explore and borrow from a diverse selection of exciting books from the National Library Board’s collection.
