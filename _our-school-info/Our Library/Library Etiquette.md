#### **Library Etiquette**

The library aims to promote the love for reading and learning through providing a comfortable and conducive environment. To keep the library environment pleasant, students are expected to observe the following library etiquette:

* Only students and staff of Fernvale Primary School are allowed in the library.
* Students are to speak softly at all times and not to run in the library.
* Students are to handle all library materials and facilities with care. Take only a few books from the shelves at a time and return them to the shelves after they have read them.
* Students are to obtain a pass from the librarian for the use of the Multimedia Stations in the library. Each session is limited to 20 minutes.
* Any student behaving unacceptably will be requested to leave the library premises for everyone's safety.
