<h2><strong>Our Motto</strong></h2>
<p>At Fernvale Primary School, we encourage our students to:
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Dare to Aspire, Courage to Excel</strong>
</p>
<p>Our motto reflects the spirit we seek to nurture in every student â€” to
be bold in setting meaningful goals, confident in taking the first step,
and resilient in overcoming challenges. We believe in empowering our students
to pursue their aspirations with purpose, to grow through effort and experience,
and to strive for excellence in all that they do. Through this journey,
they discover not only their strengths but also who they can become.
