# Principal's Message

Welcome! Fernvale Primary School is a home for our students where they can feel happy, enjoy learning and flourish. We are an inclusive school that embraces all learners regardless of their abilities and background.

In their 6 years in Fernvale, we aim to provide our students with a holistic education through our strong school-based curriculum so that they will be

**Confident Leaders** who demonstrate our school values and are equipped with the competencies to communicate effectively and lead others;

**Joyful Learners** who are curious and enjoy learning as well as working in a team to solve problems; and 

**Active Citizens** with a heart of service and one who cares for the environment.

In Fernvale, we have a team of caring and dedicated staff who goes the extra mile to help our students discover their strengths and foster a strong sense of belonging to the school. This can only be achieved with the strong support of our parents, stakeholders, and community partners.

We look forward to the continued partnership as we seek to build our students to _‘Dare to Aspire’_ and have the _‘Courage to Excel’_.
