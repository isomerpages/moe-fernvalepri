# Principal's Message

I am delighted to welcome you to our vibrant school community. At Fernvale Primary School, we are guided by our belief that every child can learn and develop a joy of learning.

Our school takes pride in being inclusive, understanding and meeting the needs of all students regardless of their abilities and background. We have cultivated a caring and enabling environment where students feel safe, accepted, empowered and competent to explore their full potential.

During their six-year journey with us, we develop our students into:

* **Confident Leaders** who embody our school values, demonstrate strong social-emotional competencies, and communicate effectively while leading others;

* **Joyful Learners** who embrace self-directed learning, think critically and creatively, maintain an active lifestyle, and appreciate aesthetics; and

* **Active Citizens** who serve their community and demonstrate care for the environment.

To achieve these outcomes, we provide a holistic education through our robust school-based curriculum. This includes our distinctive Applied Learning Programme, Learning for Life Programme, and Internationalisation Programme.

At the heart of Fernvale is our team of caring and dedicated staff who go the extra mile to make a difference in our students' lives. They work tirelessly to help each child discover their strengths and develop a strong sense of belonging to the school. This endeavour is strengthened through the invaluable support of our parents, stakeholders, and community partners.

Together as Team Fernvale, we empower our students to _'Dare to Aspire_' and instil in them the _'Courage to Excel'_.
