# Our Crest

 <img src="/images/logoFVhighres.jpg" style="width:50%">
 
The stylized letters F and V that form the integral part of the school’s logo when put together represent the cross section of a fearless head of a lion.

Courageous, bold and strong being the trademarks of a lion, it also symbolises the spirit of Fernvale Primary – “Daring and Courageous”.

Encircling the stylized letters is a solid ring that signifies an all-round, holistic education that Fernvale Primary offers to every student. Enhancing that holistic feel is the use of the colour green to communicate a “nurturing” feel.
