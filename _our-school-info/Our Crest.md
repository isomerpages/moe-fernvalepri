<h1>Our Crest</h1>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>The stylized letters F and V that form the integral part of the school’s
logo when put together represent the cross section of a fearless head of
a lion.</p>
<p>Courageous, bold and strong being the trademarks of a lion, it also symbolises
the spirit of Fernvale Primary –&nbsp;“Daring and Courageous”.</p>
<p>Encircling the stylized letters is a solid ring that signifies an all-round,
holistic education that Fernvale Primary offers to every student. Enhancing
that holistic feel is the use of the colour green to communicate a “nurturing”
feel.</p>
