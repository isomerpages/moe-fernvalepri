# Teachers' Day

Teachers’ Day in Fernvale Primary School this year will be a little special. A team of students produced this short film for our teachers. The film tells a story of a boy and his hero in the class, Mrs Neo. This film was inspired by the book,&nbsp;_The Giving Tree_&nbsp;by Shel Silverstein. Our teachers are like the self-sacrificing tree in the book who make so many sacrifices to teach and care for the students. On behalf of the students in Fernvale Primary School, the team would like to express their gratitude to all teachers and wish each of them a very Happy Teachers’ Day!
