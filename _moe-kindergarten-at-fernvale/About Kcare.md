# About KCare

Kindergarten Care (KCare) is available in all MOE Kindergartens (MK) located within primary schools providing the convenience of a full-day service. The aim of the KCare Programme is to provide a safe and conducive environment for children to play, explore and discover. Children will have a variety of experiences and develop skills, values and dispositions through their play and exploration.
