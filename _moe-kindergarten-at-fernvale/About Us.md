# About Us
## Our Vision and Mission  
To provide A Strong Start for Every Child, by providing a quality pre-school education that is affordable to Singaporeans and catalyzing quality improvements in the sector.  

In line with our beliefs that young children are curious, active and competent learners, we aim to nurture children holistically, so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.
