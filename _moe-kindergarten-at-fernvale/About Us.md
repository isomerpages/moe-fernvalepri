# About Us
![](/images/MOE%20Kindergarten%20@%20Fernvale/Picture1.jpg)

At MK@Fernvale, we believe in building positive rapport with every family under our care, and to develop a trusting relationship with your child throughout his/her Kindergarten years with us. One of the key features we offer is the weekly family-based activities which are prepared by the teachers to revisit the learning your child has experienced in school through a meaningful bonding time with the family members over the weekend.
