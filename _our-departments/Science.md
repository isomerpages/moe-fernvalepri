<h3><strong>Our Approach</strong></h3>
<p>The Science Department taps on students’ natural curiosity and adopts
an inquiry-based, student-centred approach in line with the Primary Science
Curriculum Framework. Students construct their understanding of scientific
concepts and develop process skills through hands-on exploration, guided
questioning, and evidence-based reasoning. They are encouraged to investigate
the world around them, ask meaningful questions, and test their ideas systematically.
Through this process, they acquire not only scientific knowledge but also
key process skills, ethics, and attitudes—such as perseverance, responsibility,
and integrity—which are essential to the Practice of Science and lifelong
learning.</p>

<h3><strong>Collaborative Inquiry</strong></h3>
<p>Students take ownership of the inquiry process as they work together to
plan and investigate ideas respectfully and evaluate their results to make
a conclusion.</p>
<h3><strong>Joy of Learning</strong></h3>
<p>The teaching and learning of Science go beyond the classroom, providing
students with opportunities to engage in authentic, real-world tasks. Learning
through play is also incorporated, allowing students to explore concepts
actively while assessing their own understanding and that of their peers.</p>
<h3><strong>Gamification in Science</strong></h3>
<p>Incorporating games into Science lessons brings joy to learning and boosts
student engagement, helping to deepen their understanding of key concepts.
These games are thoughtfully designed by teachers to match students’ readiness
levels and provide meaningful opportunities for them to take greater ownership
of their learning.</p>

<h3><strong>Learning Beyond the Classroom</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Eco-trail @FVPS</strong></h3>
<p>An immersive trail within the school grounds that connects students with
local biodiversity and ecological concepts.</p>

<h3><strong>Discovering Biodiversity at Mandai Wildlife</strong></h3>
<p>Primary 3 students embarked on a journey to appreciate the rich biodiversity
in our natural environment. Through a learning journey to Mandai Wildlife
and an interdisciplinary trail with a focused Science lesson, they explored
local ecosystems and observed a variety of animal species up close. These
experiences sparked curiosity about life’s diversity and helped students
understand how organisms contribute to ecological balance. Through observation
and exploration, they began to develop a sense of stewardship for nature,
recognising their role in protecting the environment and its living things.</p>

<h3><strong>Growing Ideas for a Food Sustainability</strong></h3>
<p>Aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Primary 4 students embarked
on a series of learning experiences to explore the theme of Food Sustainability.
Through the Hydroponics Programme and visits to Koh Fah Farm, Metro Farm,
and VidaCity, they discovered innovative soil-less farming and urban agriculture
practices that contribute to local food resilience. These experiences were
further enriched by the Applied Learning Programme (ALP-IPW), where students
applied design thinking to develop creative solutions for reducing food
waste and promoting responsible consumption. Together, these opportunities
nurtured critical thinking, encouraged responsible action, and inspired
students to play a part in building a more sustainable future.</p>

<h3><strong>Hydroponics Programme</strong></h3>
<p>The Hydroponics Programme introduces students to sustainable farming by
growing vegetables without soil. Through hands-on activities, they explore
how science supports food security and develop a sense of environmental
responsibility.

<h3><strong>Exploring Plant Reproduction and Energy Conservation</strong></h3>
<p>At Gardens by the Bay, Primary 5 students explored how plants reproduce
through various methods such as seed dispersal and flowering, connecting
their classroom learning to real-life examples in a rich natural setting.
They also learned how the Supertrees demonstrate energy conservation by
harnessing solar power and supporting sustainable ecosystems. This immersive
experience deepened their understanding of both plant biology and environmental
responsibility, inspiring them to adopt eco-friendly habits and contribute
to a more sustainable future.

<h3><strong>Urban Greening: Positive Impact on our Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Primary 6 students embarked on learning journeys to Bishan-AMK Park, Pasir-Ris
Mangrove Boardwalk, and the Singapore Botanic Gardens’ Rainforest to deepen
their understanding of ecosystems, adaptations, and human impact on the
environment. Through collaborative tasks, they explored issues such as
deforestation, pollution, and climate change, examining how human actions
affect natural systems. Common themes of conservation, sustainability,
and innovative land use were highlighted across the three sites, encouraging
connections to Singapore’s future environmental challenges. These experiences
nurtured environmental responsibility and strengthened students’ critical
thinking, communication, and collaboration skills.</p>

<h3><strong>Challenging our Young Inquirers</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Science Excellence 2000 (E2K) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Science Programme provides selected Primary 4 and 5 students with
opportunities to explore advanced scientific concepts through inquiry-based
investigations. Students engage in open-ended tasks that develop critical
thinking, inventive problem-solving, and scientific communication. The
programme nurtures curiosity and strengthens students’ ability to work
collaboratively to study phenomena, investigate possible causes, and discuss
ideas using scientific reasoning. Through this process, students build
strong scientific dispositions while acquiring 21st-century competencies
essential for future-ready learners.</p>

<h3><strong>Elementz Science Project Competition</strong></h3>
<p>The Elementz Science Competition, organised by Anderson Secondary School,
offers students an engaging platform to apply their scientific knowledge
and skills in creative, challenging ways. Through hands-on tasks, collaborative
problem-solving, and critical thinking, students explore key science concepts
and deepen their understanding of real-world applications. These competitions
foster a love for science while nurturing teamwork, perseverance, and innovation.</p>
