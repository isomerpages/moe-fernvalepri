# Science

### Vision  

Inquiring Minds, Learning Community

### Goal  

To nurture and develop young scientists who aspire to innovate and invent in the global community.

### Our Approach

The Science Department leverages on the child’s innate curiosity and subscribes to a student-centred learning in which students build their scientific understanding and process skills through active inquiry. It encourages students to explore beyond, as an inquirer – raising questions about things around them, testing their ideas and making evidence-based conclusions. Through scientific inquiry, students will develop the skills, ethics and attitudes such as responsibility and perseverance, which are essential to the Practice of Science.

### **SciencExperience @ FVPS**

### Collaborative Inquiry  
Students take ownership of the inquiry process as they work together to plan and investigate ideas respectfully and evaluate their results to make a conclusion.
