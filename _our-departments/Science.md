### Vision  

Inquiring Minds, Learning Community

### Goal  

To nurture and develop young scientists who aspire to innovate and invent in the global community.

### Our Approach

The Science Department leverages on the child’s innate curiosity and subscribes to a student-centred learning in which students build their scientific understanding and process skills through active inquiry. It encourages students to explore beyond, as an inquirer – raising questions about things around them, testing their ideas and making evidence-based conclusions. Through scientific inquiry, students will develop the skills, ethics and attitudes such as responsibility and perseverance, which are essential to the Practice of Science.

### **SciencExperience @ FVPS**

### Collaborative Inquiry  
Students take ownership of the inquiry process as they work together to plan and investigate ideas respectfully and evaluate their results to make a conclusion.

### Joy of Learning

The teaching and learning of Science extends beyond the classroom where students are given opportunities to be engaged in authentic tasks. Students are also engaged in learning through play as they learn and assess their peers’ learning.

P5 – Gardens by the Bay, P6 - Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve


### Learning through DI Games

Games help to infuse the joy of learning and increase student engagement level to deepen the understanding on the concepts taught. Teachers designed these games, taking into consideration the readiness level of students and including the opportunity to raise ownership in their learning.

### Challenging our Young Inquirers

### **Excellence 2000 Programme (Science)**

The E2K Science Programme is a 2 -year enrichment programme for our Primary 4 students who demonstrate interest and aptitude in Science. &nbsp;It serves to develop in these students the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess, and gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

### **Science Olympiad**  

Selected P4 &amp; P5 students are highly engaged in the Science Olympiad sessions, where they investigate scientific concepts and extend their learning with higher-order thinking skills, which prepares students for the Singapore Primary Science Olympiad (SPSO) organized by the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science.
