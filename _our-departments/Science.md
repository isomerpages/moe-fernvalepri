### Vision  

Inquiring Minds, Learning Community

### Goal  

To nurture and develop young scientists who aspire to innovate and invent in the global community.

### Our Approach

The Science Department leverages on the child’s innate curiosity and subscribes to a student-centred learning in which students build their scientific understanding and process skills through active inquiry. It encourages students to explore beyond, as an inquirer – raising questions about things around them, testing their ideas and making evidence-based conclusions. Through scientific inquiry, students will develop the skills, ethics and attitudes such as responsibility and perseverance, which are essential to the Practice of Science.

### **SciencExperience @ FVPS**

### Collaborative Inquiry  
Students take ownership of the inquiry process as they work together to plan and investigate ideas respectfully and evaluate their results to make a conclusion.

### Joy of Learning

The teaching and learning of Science extends beyond the classroom where students are given opportunities to be engaged in authentic tasks. Students are also engaged in learning through play as they learn and assess their peers’ learning.

### Learning through DI Games

Games help to infuse the joy of learning and increase student engagement level to deepen the understanding  
on the concepts taught. Teachers designed these games, taking into consideration the readiness level of students and including the opportunity to raise ownership in their learning.
