<h3><strong>1. 2025 Chinese New Year Celebration</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>On 28th January 2025, Fernvale Primary School ushered in the Year of the
Snake with a host of activities which are planned for the students. As
part of the celebrations, the students wore traditional ethnic attire to
school, making the atmosphere more vibrant and celebratory.</p>
<p>Our talented students put up a stellar performance and brought festive
joy to the audience. We had the Wushu and Guzheng CCA groups showcasing
their best efforts in this celebration. We also enjoyed a solo pipa performance
by our P5 student. The students were excited during the lion dance performance
and magic show too.</p>
<p>The concert included jovial Chinese New Year wishes by our school leaders,
staff and students. It ended on a high note with mass singing. It was a
vibrant Chinese New Year Celebrations this year and it was wonderful to
see the students’ involvement and happy faces.</p>
<p>After the concert, students were engaged in CNY craftwork activities in
the class. It was really heartening to see students working together to
complete their craftwork activity.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Reading Programme&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>To cultivate a love for reading and strengthen our students' Chinese language
skills, our school has revamped the Chinese Reading Programme this year.</p>
<p>One of the highlights is the "Reading Mum" Programme. Once a month, during
recess, parent volunteers visit the school to read Chinese storybooks to
our Primary 1 to Primary 3 students. This initiative not only encourages
young learners to enjoy reading but also promotes a strong home-school
partnership in support of language learning.</p>
<p>In addition, the MOE has introduced a new structured reading programme,
MTL SOAR, for Primary 1 and 2 students. Under this programme, Primary 1
and 2 students have 30 minutes of their MTL curriculum time set aside for
reading and library activities. Our teachers either bring the class to
the library to borrow Chinese books or conduct reading activities using
supplementary readers. This helps to develop a positive set of reading
dispositions and habits in the students from young.</p>
<p>For the middle and upper primary levels, teachers assign online Chinese
reading materials weekly. These digital resources are selected to suit
students’ reading levels and interests, making reading a continuous habit
both in and beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Through these structured programmes, our school hopes to nurture confident
and enthusiastic readers who love the Chinese language.</p>

<h3><strong>3. P6 Cultural performance Exposure Scheme 2025</strong></h3>
<p>Our Primary 6 CL students went for a Learning Journey at Hokkien Huay
Kuan under the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme on 19th May 2025.</p>
<p>They watched a play titled《三借芭蕉扇》(Borrowing the Plantain Fan). This is
a famous episode from the Chinese classic novel "Journey to the West" (西游记)
by Wu Cheng'en. In the story, the monk Tang Sanzang and his disciples,
including Sun Wukong (the Monkey King), face a fiery mountain (Flaming
Mountain 火焰山) that blocks their path. To cross it, they need a magical
plantain fan (芭蕉扇) that can extinguish the flames. However, the fan is
in the possession of Princess Iron Fan (铁扇公主), who initially refuses to
lend it. Sun Wukong had to use cunning, transformation, and persistence
to borrow the fan three times before succeeding in putting out the fire.</p>
<p>Through this play, the actors present Sun Wukong's spirit of perseverance
in the face of challenges in a lighthearted and entertaining way. This
performance uses a playful and engaging approach to show how Sun Wukong
never gives up, even when faced with great obstacles.</p>
<p>For most of the students, it was the first time that they are watching
a play, and they cherished the opportunity to watch it with their peers.
The cast also did a brilliant job of engaging and interacting with the
pupils and some of them also got a chance to act in one of the scenes!
It is indeed a valuable experience to learn about Chinese culture in a
fun and interactive way.</p>
