#### Vision

For every child to be a reflective, eloquent and confident user of the English Language

#### Goal/s

The English Department aims for our students to be reflective, eloquent and confident users of the English Language. Besides learning the technicalities of the English Language, students are also encouraged to reflect critically on a myriad of local and global issues during classroom and group discussions. Students are given various opportunities to share their thoughts and opinions with their teachers and peers by sharing in the classroom, through journalling, quick-write and ICT-based platforms.


#### Signature Programmes

**1\. Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR)** 

The teaching approaches in STELLAR have been designed to deliver the outcomes of the English Language Syllabus 2020. Through the effective use of strategies for reading speaking, writing and listening, teachers are empowered to build on the students’ foundational understanding of the English Language and to teach them critical life skills.
