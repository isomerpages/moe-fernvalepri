# English Language

#### Vision

For every child to be a reflective, eloquent and confident user of the English Language

#### Goal/s

The English Department aims for our students to be reflective, eloquent and confident users of the English Language. Besides learning the technicalities of the English Language, students are also encouraged to reflect critically on a myriad of local and global issues during classroom and group discussions. Students are given various opportunities to share their thoughts and opinions with their teachers and peers by sharing in the classroom, through journalling, quick-write and ICT-based platforms.


#### Signature Programmes

**1\. Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR)** 

The teaching approaches in STELLAR have been designed to deliver the outcomes of the English Language Syllabus 2020. Through the effective use of strategies for reading speaking, writing and listening, teachers are empowered to build on the students’ foundational understanding of the English Language and to teach them critical life skills.




**2\. Strategies to Activate Readings (StAR) for Primary 1 & 2**

StAR is a in-house programme which aims to equip pupils with the skills to:

*   master word recognition and spelling strategies
    
*   read orally with fluency
    
*   understand what they are reading
    

Lessons are conducted daily for half an hour in small groups.

**3\. PAL - Speech & Drama for Primary 1 & 2**

As part of developing the confidence level and public speaking skills in our younger pupils, the Primary 1 and 2 pupils undergo a Speech and Drama module as part of PAL. The pupils are taught presentation skills such as speaking clearly through the proper use of their voice and expressions. The pupils will put up a mini performance for their peers.

**4\.  Guided Reading Programme for Primary 1 to 3**

Through this programme, pupils are exposed to a variety of books to read during Silent Reading periods. It is part of our continuous efforts to encourage the pupils to read widely and cultivate a good reading habit.

**5\. Little Red Dot & Online Discussions for Primary 4 to 6**

To promote a greater awareness of current affairs, the upper primary pupils are encouraged to read the Straits Times and the Little Red Dot (LRD). After reading the LRD, the pupils will go online to take part in online discussions about what they have read. This also promotes collaboration skills amongst pupils.

**6\. EL Fest**

The English Language Fest is an annual event where our students can participate in different activities organised for the respective levels. It is a platform for them to strengthen and showcase their communication skills. Our department aims to inculcate a love for the English language and to encourage our students to be involved in the learning of the language. The teachers are also hoping to spark our students’ interest in the language through fun and engaging activities that extend beyond the classroom. We want our students to know that English can be fun and interesting!
