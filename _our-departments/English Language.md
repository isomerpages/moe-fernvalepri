<p>At our English Department, we strive to nurture students into reflective,
eloquent, and confident users of the English Language. Beyond mastering
language skills, students are encouraged to think critically about a wide
range of local and global issues. Through class discussions, journalling,
quick-writes, and ICT-based platforms, they are given meaningful opportunities
to express their thoughts and engage with others in a supportive learning
environment.</p>
<h3><strong>Pedagogical Approach</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR)</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopts the STELLAR approach in the teaching of English Language
and in delivering the outcomes of the English Language Syllabus 2020 (ELS
2020). Through the effective use of strategies for reading, speaking, writing
and listening, our teachers build on the foundational understanding of
the English Language using stories.</p>
