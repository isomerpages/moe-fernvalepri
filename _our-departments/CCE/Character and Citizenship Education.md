<h1>Character and Citizenship Education</h1>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education
in Singapore.</p>
<p>Through CCE, students learn&nbsp;<strong>values,&nbsp;social-emotional competencies</strong>,
and
<br>develop&nbsp;<strong>character and citizenship dispositions</strong>&nbsp;that
will enable them to grow holistically and learn for life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world,
<br>the&nbsp;<strong>knowledge,&nbsp;skills&nbsp;and&nbsp;values</strong>&nbsp;taught
in CCE will help&nbsp;our students navigate the realities of their time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to develop in our students:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Good character</strong>
<br>Have a sound moral compass and strong sense of right and wrong, think
critically and ethically, be discerning in judgement, take responsibility
for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being</strong>
<br>Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient
when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude
and appreciation
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Future Readiness</strong>
<br>Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability
and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career
pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including
the world of work and life
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Active Citizenship</strong>
<br>Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the
nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the&nbsp;future, an awareness
of the reality of Singapore's vulnerabilities and constraints, and the
will to act on improving the&nbsp;lives of others and building a future
for our nation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CCE is enacted through learning platforms such as CCE Lessons,&nbsp;Key
Student Development Experiences (SDEs),&nbsp;<strong>school-based Initiatives</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>other subjects</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>CCE Lessons</u></strong>
</p>
<p>There is emphasis on explicit teaching of social-emotional competencies
in CCE (FTGP). Topics related to developing citizenship dispositions are
taught in CCE (FTGP) to foster inter-ethnic understanding and appreciation
for one another's culture.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Student Development Experiences (SDEs)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Student Development Experiences (SDEs) are learning experiences beyond
the classroom that are integral to the holistic development of students.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Purposefully</strong>&nbsp;planned&nbsp;SDEs provide students
with varied and authentic opportunities to learn, apply and demonstrate
values, good character, social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions.
Through SDEs, students are also able to&nbsp;<strong>apply their learning</strong>&nbsp;from
Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons to authentic contexts.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>These key SDEs include:&nbsp;Co-Curricular Activities, Education and Career
Guidance Experiences (ECG), National Education Commemorative Days, Values
in Action (VIA), Student Leadership Development Programmes and Cohort Learning
Journeys.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Other subjects</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Subjects such as Art, PE, English Language and MTL provide learning opportunities
and teachable moments for students to learn and apply relevant values and
social-emotional competencies.</p>
<p>In particular, Social Studies prepares our students to be informed, concerned
and participative citizens. Through the contexts of understanding the interconnectedness
of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciating the complexities
of the human experience, SS helps students to acquire specific values and
skills for the Humanities discipline, which are key for nurturing of citizenship
dispositions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Caring and Enabling School Environment</u></strong>
</p>
<p>For CCE to have a lasting impact on our students, the school and classroom
environment need to support their learning. A caring and enabling environment
has five key features that help students feel&nbsp;<strong>safe,&nbsp;accepted,&nbsp;empowered</strong>,
and&nbsp;<strong>competent</strong>. We establish and sustain these features,
complementing them with a positive and proactive approach to discipline
and early support and intervention.</p>
