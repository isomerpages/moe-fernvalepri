<p>Our school's comprehensive approach to Social Studies and National Education
is designed to cultivate essential citizenship dispositions through meaningful
integration of commemorative events, learning journeys, and structured
discussions in both SS and FTGP lessons.
<br>
<br>Through carefully curated experiences during NE Commemorative Days (i.e.,
Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and
National Day celebrations, students develop a deep sense of belonging to
Singapore and understanding of our nation's realities.
<br>
<br>These experiences are enhanced by cohort learning journeys that provide
authentic learning opportunities, while classroom discussions and performance
tasks encourage critical thinking and individual sense-making.
<br>
<br>This integrated approach nurtures students' sense of hope and will to
act, transforming them into informed, concerned, and participative citizens
who understand Singapore's journey and challenges. By connecting academic
learning with real-world experiences, students develop not only the knowledge
but also the dispositions needed to contribute meaningfully to their community
while pursuing their personal aspirations, embodying the true spirit of
active citizenship.</p>
