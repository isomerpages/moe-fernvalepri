**Using Tablets for Teaching and Learning**  
The evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) necessitates new forms of pedagogy in education. Leveraging the myriad affordances of ICT, Fernvale primary has adopt mobile teaching and learning tool to enhance lessons, language proficiency, and deliver new learning experiences for his students. The programme started with equipping an experimental class of 16 with android tablets and also another 29 tablets to the Mother Tongue and PE department. 

Using the tablets, students are able to watch teaching video clips, view slides, participate in quizzes and provide timely feedbacks to their teachers. The social networking functions of the tool also allow students to engage in discussion and interact with their classmates and teachers as part of an effort to integrate real life use of the language into their learning.  
Technology-rich activities can sustain high levels of student engagement and peer collaboration compared to less technology focused activities. Mobile learning makes it possible for the teachers to extend education beyond the physical confines of the classroom and beyond the fixed time periods of the school day. It allows students to access content from home, communicate with teachers, and work with other people online. The value of mobile devices is that they allow students to connect, communicate, collaborate and create using rich digital resources.
