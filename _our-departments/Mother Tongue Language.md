<p>The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department at Fernvale Primary School
is dedicated to nurturing students' proficiency and appreciation of their
respective mother tongue languages - Chinese, Malay and Tamil. Through
engaging pedagogies and culturally rich programmes, our experienced MTL
teachers create immersive learning environments that help students develop
strong foundational language skills whilst fostering a deep connection
to their cultural roots. The department organises various activities throughout
the academic year, including festive celebrations, reading activities,
and language competitions, to provide authentic learning opportunities
for students to apply their language skills and develop a genuine love
for their Mother Tongue.</p>
