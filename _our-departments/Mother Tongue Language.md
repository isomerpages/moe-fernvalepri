#### 4\.P6 Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme 2024

Our Primary 6 CL pupils went for a Learning Journey at Hokkien Huay Kuan under the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme on 3 May 2024. 

They watched a play titled《周处除三害》 (Zhou Chu Gets Rid of the 3 Evils). It is about the main character Zhou Chu and how he became a better person after getting rid of the three evil characters in the story. 

For most of the pupils, it was the first time that they are watching a play, and they cherished the opportunity to watch it with their peers. The cast also did a brilliant job of engaging and interacting with the pupils and some of them also got a chance to act in one of the scenes! It is indeed a valuable experience to learn about Chinese culture in a fun and interactive way.

**Thamizhai Nesipom      Thamizhil Pesuvom**

To foster effective communication skills, we use innovative, level-specific approaches. For Primary 1 to 4, we use the ThingLink App with custom illustrations of school activities to enhance oral engagement. For Primary 5 and 6, we use oral video stimuli with analytical rubrics to boost critical thinking and articulation. These initiatives aim to develop confident, articulate communicators ready for an ever-evolving world.  

**Collaborative Writing Strategy**  

In our department, we embrace collaborative writing strategies to enhance writing proficiency amongst our pupils. By working together in groups, pupils cultivate essential communication and teamwork skills while collectively brainstorming ideas and refining their writing. This approach not only promotes a supportive learning environment but also fosters creativity and critical thinking as pupils learn from one another's perspectives. Through collaborative writing, our pupils develop confidence in their writing abilities.

**Mother Tongue Language Fortnight 2024 (TL)**

MTL Fortnight is a cherished tradition at Fernvale, offering Tamil pupils a journey through language with AKT Productions. Professional storytellers, speakers, puppeteers, and actors bring the Tamil Language to life, captivating our pupils with their diverse talents.

Each year, pupils experience:
Primary 1: Storytelling
Primary 2: Storytelling with puppets
Primary 3: Storytelling with songs

These immersive experiences deepen pupils' connection to Tamil, fostering cultural appreciation and linguistic proficiency.

    

  

6\. **Language cum Talent Competitions**  

We see both the internal and external competitions as good platforms for our pupils to become confident speakers of the Tamil Language. &nbsp;Hence, our pupils are strongly encouraged to take part in these competitions every year. To ensure that every Tamil child in our school gets an opportunity to take part in a competition, ‘Kavinkalai’ competitions are organised and held yearly. &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, ‘Kavinkalai” has gained popularity among our children and it is heartwarming to see an increase in the participation rate.

  

7\. **Diwali Dazzle**

Our annual ‘Diwali Dazzle’ is another platform that enables our pupils to showcase their hidden talents. &nbsp;‘Diwali Dazzle’ is an annual concert which is held on the eve of Deepavali. Within a minimum time span of thirty minutes, our pupils together with our parent volunteers put up marvellous performances during this concert, making it to be the limelight of stage performances at Fernvale every year.

  

8\. **Toastmasters In Tamil**

The ‘Toastmasters In Tamil’ workshop is designed specially for our Primary 5 pupils. &nbsp;We are one of the first few schools to implement this programme in Tamil for primary school pupils. &nbsp;The two day programme serves as a platform for our students to overcome their fear and anxiety towards public speaking and to improve on their public speaking skills. &nbsp;Pupils are mentored by our very own parent volunteer who has been trained and has several years of experience as a Tamil Toastmaster.
