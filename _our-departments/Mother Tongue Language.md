#### 2\. Reading Programme  
  

The CL Dept Reading Programme has been rolled out this year and our target audience is the lower primary pupils. Structured time for teachers to carry out the programme has been planned and incorporated into the Scheme of Work. The programme comprises activities such as a story-telling session conducted by our own CL teachers, the making of mini story-book, role-play as well as activity sheets where the children write a

book review and reflect on the learning points gleaned from the programme.
