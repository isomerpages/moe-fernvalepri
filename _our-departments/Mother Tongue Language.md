#### 4\.P6 Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme 2024

Our Primary 6 CL pupils went for a Learning Journey at Hokkien Huay Kuan under the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme on 3 May 2024. 

They watched a play titled《周处除三害》 (Zhou Chu Gets Rid of the 3 Evils). It is about the main character Zhou Chu and how he became a better person after getting rid of the three evil characters in the story. 

For most of the pupils, it was the first time that they are watching a play, and they cherished the opportunity to watch it with their peers. The cast also did a brilliant job of engaging and interacting with the pupils and some of them also got a chance to act in one of the scenes! It is indeed a valuable experience to learn about Chinese culture in a fun and interactive way.
