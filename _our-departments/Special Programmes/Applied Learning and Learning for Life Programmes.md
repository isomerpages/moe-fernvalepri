# Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) and Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

In **C.A.R.E.** (**C**ontributing **A**ctively; **R**eimagining our **E**nvironment), students work effectively and harmoniously with one another. They explore and exchange ideas on ways to engage communities and eco-partners. Student leaders lead their peers in these discussions. They provide suggestions, facilitate conversations and plan meaningful activities together to connect with the various stakeholders.


Through **C.A.R.E**, students become more aware of issues in our communities. The interactions with stakeholders help develop an appreciation towards cultural diversity. These experiences help students to demonstrate the school values actively as they serve the community and care for the environment.
