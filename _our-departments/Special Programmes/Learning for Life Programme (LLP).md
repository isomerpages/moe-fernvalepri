# Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

The LLP aims to provide students with real-life experiences to develop character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their people skills.   

## Greenova - Innovation in our Green Efforts

Fernvale Primary’s Learning for Life Programme, Greenova, supports the learning of values and develops socio-emotional competencies in our students through our green efforts towards environment sustainability.

## World Water Day Commemoration

In Fernvale Primary School, every year, we celebrate World Water Day in the month of March, to pledge our national commitment to water conservation.

Students learn about the importance of water and Singapore’s efforts to conserve water through an Assembly talk by Waterways Watch Society.

A team of students from the Environmental Science Club made a DIY Window Garden using upcycled plastic milk bottles that they had collected.

The students from Environmental Science Club also initiated a Classroom Recycling Corner Competition to encourage  
all classes to make good use of the existing recycling corners in our classrooms.

The Art Club Juniors shared with the school about their upcycling project using unwanted glass and plastic food bottles. A video showing the processes involved in the cleaning and decorating of old food bottles by the Art Club Juniors was played during school assembly.

The upcycled items were exhibited along the corridor at level 1. Students visited the exhibition during recess and completed a survey about upcycling and to share their interest in contributing towards a more sustainable environment.

Finally, as we work towards our Zero Waste Target, FVPS had an e-waste collection drive. Staff brought unwanted e-waste such as laptops, tablets and keyboards and dropped them into the bin.
