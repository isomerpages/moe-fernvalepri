<h1>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</h1>
<p>The LLP aims to provide students with real-life experiences to develop
character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and
strengthen their people skills.</p>
<h2>Greenova - Innovation in our Green Efforts</h2>
<p>Fernvale Primary’s Learning for Life Programme, Greenova, supports the
learning of values and develops socio-emotional competencies in our students
through our green efforts towards environment sustainability.</p>
<h2>World Water Day Commemoration</h2>
<p>In Fernvale Primary School, every year, we celebrate World Water Day in
the month of March, to pledge our national commitment to water conservation.</p>
<p>Students learn about the importance of water and Singapore’s efforts to
conserve water through an Assembly talk by Waterways Watch Society.</p>

visited the exhibition during recess and completed a survey about upcycling
and to share their interest in contributing towards a more sustainable
environment.</p>

<p>Finally, as we work towards our Zero Waste Target, FVPS had an e-waste

and keyboards and dropped them into the bin.</p>
