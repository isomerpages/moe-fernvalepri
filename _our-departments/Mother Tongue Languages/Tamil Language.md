<h3>Department Programmes:</h3>
<p>At our school, the Tamil Language department nurtures a love for reading
through our engaging Tamil Reading Chest Programme. Pupils set reading
goals each term, and those who meet them are proudly recognized with Certificates
of Achievement. These goals empower pupils to take charge of their own
reading journey.</p>
<p>Fortnightly library visits offer quiet reading time, exposing pupils to
a variety of genres and helping them discover their reading preferences.
To further spark interest, our teachers conduct lively storytelling sessions
during recess, bringing Tamil stories to life in fun and relatable ways.
These sessions are often followed by engaging activities such as quizzes,
bookmark-making, and other creative tasks that deepen pupils’ connection
with the stories and make reading a joyful experience.</p>
<p>To make the library experience even more captivating, a thematic reading
corner is specially decorated each term, with carefully curated Tamil books
related to the theme on display. This dynamic space draws pupils in and
encourages them to explore books connected to the themes, sparking curiosity
and inspiring them to read more widely.</p>
<p>We also embrace digital learning through multimodal book reviews using
the Book Creator app. This allows pupils to reflect on what they’ve read
and present their thoughts creatively, enhancing both their digital skills
and creative thinking skills.</p>
<p>Through this programme, we strive to grow joyful, confident and thoughtful
Tamil readers in every child.</p>

<h3><strong>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight Activities - Kavinkalai Tamil Language Competitions</strong></h3>
<p>As part of our annual Mother Tongue Fortnight celebrations, the Tamil
Language department organises the Kavinkalai Internal Tamil Language Competitions—a
signature event that has been running for the past 10 years. While the
fortnight offers a range of activities that deepen pupils’ appreciation
for Tamil language and culture, this competition serves as a meaningful
platform to nurture confidence and self-expression. Unlike external competitions
that allow only a limited number of participants, our internal platform
is inclusive, welcoming any pupil with the interest and passion to take
part.</p>
<p>Held in Week 3 of Term 3 each year, the competition gives pupils a purposeful
way to use their June holidays to prepare and polish their entries. The
competitions are customised for Primary 3 to 6 pupils, with participants
grouped by readiness levels to ensure a fair and encouraging experience.
High-readiness pupils compete within their band, while developing learners
are given space to shine among peers of similar readiness. This approach
builds confidence and fosters a positive connection with the language.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we aim to provide pupils with a meaningful and memorable
experience—one that encourages self-discovery and helps them realise their
unique talents. It’s not just about winning, but about expressing themselves
and taking pride in their Tamil language journey.</p>
<p>Through this initiative, we strive to create equitable opportunities for
all learners, while promoting a healthy sense of competition and appreciation
for the Tamil language.</p>

<h3><strong>Deepavali Celebrations @ Fernvale</strong></h3>
<p>At Fernvale, our annual Deepavali celebrations are thoughtfully designed
to help pupils appreciate the rich cultural diversity around them. The
celebration comprises two meaningful parts.</p>
<p>The first involves a school-wide initiative where every class participates
in decorating their learning space to usher in the festive spirit. Conducted
during Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons, this activity
allows pupils to understand the significance of Deepavali and learn about
the cultural meaning behind traditional decorative items found in Hindu
culture. These sessions not only foster cultural awareness but also encourage
teamwork and creativity.</p>
<p>The second part of the celebration is the Deepavali Concert, an annual
highlight where pupils are treated to a vibrant showcase of Indian performing
arts. Each year, the concert is built around a unique theme that connects
cultural practices to broader areas of knowledge. For instance, the 2024
year’s theme, “Math is All Around Us,” demonstrated how mathematical concepts
are naturally embedded in Indian rhythms, Indian patterns (Rangoli), and
even festive cuisine. Through such experiences, our pupils deepen their
appreciation of culture while also discovering how traditions can reflect
and reinforce learning in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Together, these two components aim to make Deepavali not just a celebration,
but a valuable learning journey for every pupil.</p>
