Our vision is to cultivate an environment where students confidently embrace digital learning, becoming self-directed learners in alignment with the **MOE ICT Masterplan 2030**.

This is achieved through:
* **Strategic Integration of ICT Skills:** We empower students to effectively select and apply appropriate digital tools for organizing and managing information.

* **Development of Critical and Creative Thinking:** A key component involves guiding students to independently evaluate the reliability of online sources.

* **Enhanced Communication and Collaboration:** By leveraging diverse digital platforms, students are enabled to communicate their ideas with clarity and connect meaningfully with their peers, fostering a collaborative learning atmosphere and promoting a deeper understanding of subject matter.

* **Cultivation of Digital Citizenship:** Crucially, our students receive education on positive online behaviors and develop an awareness of how to protect themselves in the digital space.

<b>Using Digital Devices for Teaching and Learning</b>

The evolution of Information and Communication Technology(ICT) necessitates new forms of pedagogy in education. Leveraging the myriad affordances of ICT, Fernvale Primary has adopted mobile teaching and learning tools to enhance lessons, language proficiencies. We have equipped our classes with more than 300 iPads and close to 100 brand new laptops. Technology-rich activities can sustain high levels of student engagement and peer collaboration.
