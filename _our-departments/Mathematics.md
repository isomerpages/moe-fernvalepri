<p>At our Mathematics Department, we believe in fostering a supportive and
engaging learning environment where students can truly enjoy and embrace
learning. That's why we emphasize experiential learning through activity-based
lessons and learning trails. These opportunities help students grasp mathematical
concepts, understand their connections, and see their real-world applications.</p>
<p>Designed to motivate students both inside and outside the classroom, these
experiences encourage them to apply their critical, adaptive and inventive
thinking, collaborative, and problem-solving skills. Students are prompted
to think critically and reflect on their learning. We also leverage Information
and Communications Technology (ICT) to further enhance their learning experiences.</p>
<h3><strong>Activity-Based Lessons</strong></h3>
<p>Fernvalelions actively participate in a variety of authentic and interesting
activity-based tasks, allowing them to construct their own understanding
and knowledge from these experiences. These lessons are designed to build
a strong foundation in Mathematics, utilizing supporting manipulatives
and materials that align with the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach.
This method ensures students grasp concepts by first manipulating physical
objects, then visualizing them, and finally understanding their abstract
representations.</p>

<h3><strong>Authenticate learning and application through learning trails</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Interactive Learning Trails</strong> help our Primary 1 to 6 students
discover the relevance of mathematics by exploring its real-world applications.
These trails provide opportunities for students to apply their conceptual
knowledge and skills to solve authentic problems. By complementing classroom
learning, these trails ensure students develop a deeper appreciation and
enjoyment of mathematics in everyday situations.

<h3><strong>Primary 1 to 4 Learning Support Programme (LSM) &amp; P1 &amp; P2 LSM Numeracy Enrichment Programme (NEP)</strong></h3>
<p>The Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme is an early intervention
initiative designed to provide targeted support for selected Primary 1
to Primary 4 students. It aims to help them access the Mathematics curriculum
effectively and strengthen their numeracy skills and conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>The programme is guided by the ICAN principles (Involvement, Collaboration,
Assessment, and eNcouragement) and emphasizes the development of fundamental
mathematical concepts through engaging, hands-on activities.</p>
<p>To make the learning of Mathematics enjoyable and meaningful, a numeracy
enrichment component is included. This enrichment leverages gamified learning
approaches to help students concretise abstract mathematical ideas in a
fun and interactive way.</p>

<h3>Fun with Math Gym!</h3>
<p>"Fun with Math Gym" is designed to bring elements of fun, discovery, and
exploration into Mathematics learning. Through this initiative, students
engage with mathematical patterns in a non-threatening and stimulating
environment that fosters curiosity and develops logical reasoning skills.
Questions are uploaded onto the SLS platform, where students participate
in monthly quizzes. Winners are recognized and rewarded with prizes, adding
excitement and motivation to the learning experience.

<h3>E2K Math Programme</h3>
<p>The programme challenges students to explore Mathematics beyond the core
curriculum and its extensions, while strengthening their ability to tackle
higher-order thinking questions. Since 2019, the E2K Math Programme has
been offered to Primary 4 students who demonstrate a strong interest and
advanced aptitude in the subject. Through collaborative discussions, students
actively share their ideas and experiment with various strategies and approaches
to problem-solving, fostering deep mathematical thinking and confidence.</p>
