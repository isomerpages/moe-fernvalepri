# Mathematics
### Vision

Every Fernvale pupil, a logical thinker and creative problem solver nurtured by passionate Mathematics teachers.

### Goal

We aim to develop pupils as confident, creative and competent Mathematics problem solvers.

### Signature Programmes

Experiential Learning  
The department believes in creating a supportive and engaging learning environment so that students love and enjoy learning. As such, learning experiences through activity-based lessons and trails are conducted to help students develop an understanding of concepts and make sense of mathematical ideas, their connections and applications to the real world. Through these experiential opportunities planned to motivate them to learn both in and beyond the classrooms, students apply their analytical, collaborative and problem solving skills to think and reflect upon their own learning. The use of ICT is leveraged to some extent to enhance students’ learning.

### Activity-Based Lessons

Students participate in a range of authentic and interesting Activity-Based tasks and construct their knowledge and learning from these experiences. These lessons help our students build strong foundation in Mathematics with the use of supporting manipulatives and materials based on the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach.

Numeracy lessons engage and help our Primary 1, 2 and 3 students build a strong foundation in the learning of Mathematics through the use of manipulatives and differentiated activity tasks
