# Mathematics
### Vision

Every Fernvale pupil, a logical thinker and creative problem solver nurtured by passionate Mathematics teachers.

### Goal

We aim to develop pupils as confident, creative and competent Mathematics problem solvers.

### Signature Programmes

Experiential Learning  
The department believes in creating a supportive and engaging learning environment so that students love and enjoy learning. As such, learning experiences through activity-based lessons and trails are conducted to help students develop an understanding of concepts and make sense of mathematical ideas, their connections and applications to the real world. Through these experiential opportunities planned to motivate them to learn both in and beyond the classrooms, students apply their analytical, collaborative and problem solving skills to think and reflect upon their own learning. The use of ICT is leveraged to some extent to enhance students’ learning.

### Activity-Based Lessons

Students participate in a range of authentic and interesting Activity-Based tasks and construct their knowledge and learning from these experiences. These lessons help our students build strong foundation in Mathematics with the use of supporting manipulatives and materials based on the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach.

Numeracy lessons engage and help our Primary 1, 2 and 3 students build a strong foundation in the learning of Mathematics through the use of manipulatives and differentiated activity tasks

### Math Trails  

Interactive Math Trails help Primary 1 to 6 students value Mathematics by giving them an opportunity to discover its applications in the real world and apply skills to solve real-life problems. The activities rich in problem-solving application range from that of Whole Numbers to Money, Length, Fractions, Geometry and others. Through complementing the content of Mathematics taught in the classrooms, the trails ensure that students develop an appreciation and enjoyment of Mathematics in everyday situations.

Students measure the things around them including
the breadth of the door and their student diary with their hands and ruler.

### Learning Support Programme for Primary 1 & 2

Learning Support for Mathematics Programme for selected P1& P2 pupils is an early intervention effort aimed at providing support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access thecurriculum. The LSM Programme adopts the ICAN Principles and incorporates the building of fundamental concepts through hands-on activities in its delivery of lessons. Students identified were supported by a LSM-trained teacher during the Math periods.

### Improving Confidence & Achieving Numeracy (ICAN) Programme

ICAN Programme aims to equip students who need additional support to acquire knowledge and skills in numeracy and strategies such as Factual Fluency and dispositions to learn and achieve in Mathematics. The lessons follow the FREMC (Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery & Consolidation) framework and the 8 Principles of ICAN adopted motivate students in learning Mathematics, as well as help them deal with anxiety in the subject.

### Fun with Math Gym!

Elements of fun, discovery & exploration and concepts of solving Math patterns are executed through ‘Fun with Math Gym’ to inject fun and curiosity and infuse logical reasoning skills in students while learning in a non-threatening environment. Questions are uploaded onto the SLS platform and students take part in monthly quizzes and winners are awarded prizes.

### Math Olympiad Programme

The department believes in challenging students with high abilities in Math beyond the core curriculum and its extensions. Selected Primary 3, Primary 4 & Primary 5 students take part in the Math Olympiad Programme so that they learn and explore broader and deeper mathematical concepts, as well as receive training to be equipped with skills to handle higher-order thinking questions.

Our Primary 4 and Primary 5 students represented the school in external Math Olympiad competitions. They participated in the Annual Mathlympics organised by Anglo-Chinese School and National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) organised by organised by NUS High School. They had garnered impressive results of 5 Bronze and 6 Honourable Mention. Congrats to our recipients

### N3 Cluster Mathematics Games Day

The N3 Cluster Mathematics Games Day organised yearly by Pei Hwa Secondary School aims to provide a platform for students to develop critical and creative thinking to solve problems through fun activities and how to learn how to work in teams. Two of our Primary 6 teams participated and had garnered impressive results. One team had achieved First Position (Champion) and anther team, Top 10 Placing.

### E2K Math Programme

The programme challenges students to explore the subject beyond the core curriculum and its extensions, as well as build their skills to handle higher-order thinking questions. From year 2019, the E2K Math Programme was rolled out to selected Primary 4 students who had demonstrated interest and advanced ability in Mathematics. Students participated actively by sharing their ideas aloud and explored different approaches and strategies to solve the problems.

### Professional Development & Learning

Our teachers constantly engage themselves in professional development and learning opportunities to strengthen their pedagogical skills so as to enhance the learning and achievement of the students. Discussions of Math pedagogies and assessment strategies are regularly conducted via internal platforms such as the weekly Math PETALS and school-based bite-sized sharing sessions by the Senior Teachers, as well as expertise & support received from external agencies, e.g. North Zone cluster, Academy of Teachers of Singapore, (AST), MOE CPDD Math Unit and National Institute of Education (NIE)..
