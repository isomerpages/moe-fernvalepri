<p><strong>C.A.R.E.</strong> (<strong>C</strong>ontributing <strong>A</strong>ctively; <strong>R</strong>eimagining
our <strong>E</strong>nvironment) is Fernvale Primary Schoolâ€™s Learning
for Life Programme (LLP) and Applied Learning Programme (ALP). It nurtures
students to <em>C.A.R.E</em> for the community and environment. This is a
cornerstone to becoming <strong>active citizens</strong>.</p>
<p>In our LLP, <strong>C.A.R.E. </strong>help students to raise awareness
on issues in our communities as they develop empathy and the drive in them
to contribute actively. Their experiences interacting with stakeholders
will help students demonstrate the school values actively as they serve
the school &amp; communities. The efforts are:</p>

<p>To support the LLP and ALP, <strong>C.A.R.E.</strong> provides opportunities
for students to be <strong>confident leaders</strong>. Student leaders display
leadership qualities as they plan and lead their peers in school/community
and environmental efforts. Student leaders lead their peers in these discussions
to provide suggestions, facilitate conversations and plan meaningful activities
together to connect with our school community and various stakeholders.
