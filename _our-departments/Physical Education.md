## Signature Programmes

**1) NAPFA**  

Every year, our Primary 4 and Primary 6 pupils take the NAPFA Test.  This test  involves a series of five stations and a 1.6-km Walk-Run for primary school students.  5 stations are attempted on the same day, with a 2–5 minute rest period permitted, and the 1.6km Walk-Run station will be tested on a different day within the next 2 weeks. 

  

The test items are:

1.  **Sit-ups: Maximum number of repetitions in one minute**
2.  **Standing Broad Jump: Better of two attempts**
3.  **Sit and Reach: Better of two attempts**
4.  **Inclined Pull-ups (for all females, and males up to the age of 14): Maximum number of repetitions in half-a-minute**
5.  **Shuttle Run: Faster of two 4×10 metre attempts**
6.  **2.4-km/1.6-km Walk-Run: Minimum time taken to complete the distance**

The teachers motivate the students with target setting strategies, and students track their performance over time in their School Diary. Students will be able to work on their own progress and performance and strive to work towards a healthier body  
 

**2) P3 to P5 Inter-class Games**

This annual sports event provide Primary 3, 4 and 5 pupils the opportunity to participate in modified games and sports which are aligned with the PE syllabus to showcase their level of learning and understanding. This platform provides pupils with the opportunity to display the five school values and foster the Olympic spirit of respect, friendship and excellence among our pupils.

**3) P1 & P2 Lower Primary Games Carnival**

This annual event aims to allow pupils to have a meaningful Children’s Day.

This is to promote the welfare and well-being of our pupils.
