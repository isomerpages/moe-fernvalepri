<p><strong>P1 &amp; P2 Lower Primary Games Day</strong>
</p>
<p>This annual event is a milestone activity that our lower primary children
look forward to every year. Other than providing an opportunity for students
to apply the skills and techniques they learnt during PE lessons in a fun
and dynamic setting, this event encourages the students to work together
in teams, promoting cooperation, communication and teamwork. This games
day is a valuable extension of PE lesson, providing a holistic approach
to supporting physical social and emotional development.</p>

<p><strong>Play @ Recess</strong>
<br>Unstructured recess play provides students with an opportunity to engage
in physical activities, helping to improve their fitness, coordination,
and motor skills. Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining
a healthy lifestyle. Play@Recess also gives students the chance to manage
their emotions and develop resilience. They learn to cope with challenges,
disappointments, and successes in a natural setting. This is an important
mental break from structured learning, allowing students to return to the
classroom refreshed and ready to learn.</p>
