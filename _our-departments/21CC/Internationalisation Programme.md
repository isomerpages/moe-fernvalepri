<p>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overseas immersion trip to Hong Kong for selected
P5 students.</p>
<p>
<br>On 19 May 2025, a group of 20 students and 6 educators embarked on an
exciting overseas learning journey to Hong Kong. The four-day trip was
filled with opportunities for students to explore cross-cultural understanding,
sustainability, innovation, and social enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong> began with check-in at Changi Airport Terminal 3
before flying off to Hong Kong. Upon arrival, students visited <em>The Mills</em>,
where they went on a guided tour of the revitalised textile factory turned
creative hub. A hands-on recycling workshop allowed them to create unique
eggshell ceramic keychains — a meaningful way to learn about sustainable
practices.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong> featured the Disney Youth Education Series (Y.E.S.)
Programme, where students experienced learning beyond the classroom through
interactive, theme park-based education. They also hopped aboard the iconic
Ding Ding Tram and enjoyed panoramic views of the city skyline from Victoria
Peak — immersing themselves in the sights and stories of Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3</strong> was a highlight as students took part in a school
exchange programme at C.C.C. Kei Tsun Primary School. The immersion experience
fostered friendships and cultural appreciation. Later in the day, students
visited <em>Dignity Kitchen</em>, a social enterprise that originated in
Singapore, gaining insights into how inclusive employment practices are
expanded internationally. They then explored the historical <em>Kowloon Walled City Park</em> and
concluded with a visit to <em>Tai Kwun</em>, a beautifully restored heritage
site that was once the Central Police Station compound.</p>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong> wrapped up the journey with a visit to <em>Mei Ho House</em>,
a museum that showcases the lives of early public housing residents in
Hong Kong — offering rich insights into the city’s past and present.</p>
<p>This overseas trip not only deepened students' global perspectives but
also inspired them with real-life applications of resilience, innovation,
and empathy.</p>
