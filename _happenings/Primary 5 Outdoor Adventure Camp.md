<p>At this yearâ€™s Primary 5 Adventure Camp, our P5 Fernvalions embarked on
an unforgettable journey, learning our school core values of care, respect,
and resilience. Through a variety of outdoor activities and team challenges,
we built strong relationships with our peers and teachers, fostering a
sense of unity and support. As we faced and overcame challenges together,
we have emerged stronger as a cohesive team, ready to take on future challenges.
Inspired by our wonderful experiences in the nature, our Fernvalions pledged
to save the Earth by adopting a more healthy, sustainable diet, committing
to practices that protect our planet. This camp not only shaped our character
but also ignited our passion and belief for a better world.</p>
