<p><strong>Aesthetics Week is a week-long programme that allows students and teachers to not only experience but showcase their talents through Art and Music. The theme for this year’s Aesthetics Week is ‘Aesthetics for Tomorrow’. This explores not only how technology can be integrated into the Aesthetics but how Aesthetics can play an important role to help our students be future-ready and advocates for our tomorrow.</strong>
