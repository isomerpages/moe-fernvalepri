<p>In " Building Dreams: Transforming Cardboard into Reality," we follow
Nur Irfan Wahyudi, a passionate young builder, as he leads his team in
Round 2 of the STEM Playground Challenge 2024. Tasked with designing a
chair using corrugated cardboard, Nur Irfan's love for construction drives
him to create a chair strong enough to hold a 30kg child. The main challenge?
Ensuring the chair's strength. By using double corrugated cardboard, the
team overcomes this hurdle, learning invaluable lessons in engineering
and sturdiness. Throughout the process, Nur Irfan discovers the power of
teamwork, realizing that combining everyone's ideas and skills results
in the best outcomes. His dedication and enthusiasm not only lead to a
successful project but also inspire his peers to pursue their own creative
engineering endeavours.</p>
