# Floorball

At Fernvale Primary School, we aim to encourage and develop the love for sports including Floorball. It is an exciting and a fast-paced game played indoors. Our up-and-rising team has achieved a lot since we first started. We have competed in the  

National Primary Schools Floorball Championship and have worked our way up to attain the following achievements. We will continue to grow to achieve greater victories with continuous parents’ support.
