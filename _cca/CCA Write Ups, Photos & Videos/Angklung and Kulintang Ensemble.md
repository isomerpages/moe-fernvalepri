<h3><strong>Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble</strong></h3>
<p>The Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble offers pupils a unique opportunity
to explore traditional Southeast Asian musical heritage through hands-on
experience with the angklung and kulintang. These instruments, made of
bamboo and metal respectively, are played as part of an ensemble, requiring
strong coordination, listening skills, and teamwork.</p>
<p>Established in 2022, the Fernvale Primary Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble
welcomes students of all backgrounds to express themselves through melodious
performances and to grow their appreciation for cultural music. Although
a relatively new CCA, our ensemble has steadily built a foundation of dedication,
harmony, and musicality.</p>
<p>We believe every member plays an important role in creating a unified
sound. Our sessions provide a nurturing and collaborative space for pupils
to develop musical techniques, understand rhythms, and build confidence
in public performance.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>The Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble aims to:</p>

<br><strong>2025</strong>: Hari Raya Concert, Racial Harmony Day &amp; Celebration

<p>These performances have given our members valuable stage experience and
fostered a sense of pride and belonging.</p>
<p>In 2026, the ensemble looks forward to participating in the <strong>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation</strong> for
the very first time â€” a significant milestone in our musical journey.
