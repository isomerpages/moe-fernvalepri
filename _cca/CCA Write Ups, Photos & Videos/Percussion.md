# Percussion

A percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater; struck, scraped or rubbed by hand or struck against another similar instrument.

Percussion CCA started in 2010 with us emerging second runner-up in the National Creative Percussion Competition. Currently, our Percussion group, Fernvale Rhythm, is learning the Brazilian rhythm which is mainly from Rio and Bahia. They are handling Brazilian drums like surdo, caixa repeniques and snare. These wonderful instruments, together with the tamborines and agogo bells, gel together to create the sound of batucada - energetic, fun and creative.

We aim to develop the students to acquire strong foundation in Percussion and cultivate appreciation of the samba percussion.
