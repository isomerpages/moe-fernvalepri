### <b><u>Green Club 2019</u></b>

Members contributed actively to the environment and community through simple acts of green. Pupils will be the ambassadors for a number of initiatives in support of the 3Rs, energy and water conservation and waste management. The pupils were engaged through fun and meaningful activities during the CCA sessions. They were given platforms to share environmental projects and advocate greening efforts during school and community events. 
Pupils were given opportunities to work as a team and be innovative in coming up with environmental solutions in solving real life issues.

### <b><u>Green Club - World Water Day 2019</u></b>

In term 1, our Green Club members created prototypes with microbit programming that can remind people of water-saving habits. On World Water Day 2019, we witnessed the microbits in action, providing solutions to real-world problems. We truly believe this process would spur student engagement and drive coding achievement, which is integral to building 21st century skills
