### <b><u>Cooking up a storm</u></b>
A Scout is adept at surviving outdoors. Our cubs learn useful skills, such as outdoor cooking and tent pitching, which they get to put into practice during camp.

### <b><u>Sharpening our minds</u></b>

When we are not having fun outdoors, our cubs  also spend time exploring the sciences. Astrology, chemical reactions, and life cycles of animals are just about some of the things we learn about.
