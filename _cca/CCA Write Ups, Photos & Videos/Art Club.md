# Art Club

Art Club is a CCA that emphasises on character development in our students in alignment to our School Values and a platform for students to express themselves through various art forms and media. Students develop art skills as well as confidence as they learn to express their thoughts and ideas through artmaking and journalling. Students are provided with opportunities to explore two-dimensional and three-dimensional art such as painting, ceramics and creating artworks using reused materials. To develop self-confidence and leadership skills, students are also provided opportunities to provide peer support for their teams and showcase their artworks in the school.
