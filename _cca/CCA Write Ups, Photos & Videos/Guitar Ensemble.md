# Guitar Ensemble
The guitar is a string instrument of the chordophone family constructed from wood and strung with either nylon or steel strings. The modern guitar was preceded by the lute, vihuela, four-course renaissance guitar and five-course baroque guitar; all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.

Fernvale Primary Guitar Ensemble was established in year 2012.  In our ensemble, we believe that every member is important and everyone has a role to play.   

Fernvale Primary Guitar Ensemble provides a relaxed and open-minded environment for all students with a love for music and guitar to learn and play together.

Students of any skill levels are encouraged to come and share their techniques with other members.
