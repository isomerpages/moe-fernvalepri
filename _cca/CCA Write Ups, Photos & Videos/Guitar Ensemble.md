# Guitar Ensemble
The guitar is a string instrument of the chordophone family constructed from wood and strung with either nylon or steel strings.&nbsp;The modern guitar was preceded by the lute, vihuela, four-course renaissance guitar and five-course baroque guitar; all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.
