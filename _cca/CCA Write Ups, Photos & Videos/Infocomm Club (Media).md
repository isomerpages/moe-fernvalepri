# Infocomm Club (Media)

A team of 40 young journalists in Media Journalism Club, under the guidance of a team of dedicated and experienced professional photographers and videographers, document the lives of Fernvale students and capture precious moments that turn into fond memories. The team is made up of two groups, one focusing on photo-journalism and the other on short film production. It is our dream that our work will evoke fond memories and emotions in our audience.

### <b><u>Vision</u></b>

To be the crew any school would turn to for event media coverage and publishing.

### <b><u>Mission</u></b>

To provide reliable and superior photography and videography services for the benefit and enjoyment of our audience.
