# Infocomm Club (Media)


## Our Vision 

To enable a community that is constantly learning about digital media literacy.


## Our Mission<


To enlighten, understand and improve the students’ skills in communication in the digital media world.

### <b><u> Our Aim</u></b>


We aim to spark a passion for photography, videography and creative designing. We extend students’ learning by engaging them in workshops and in competitions to gain greater exposure. Students will be trained to use high-end equipment such as DSLRs and software to enhance post-production of their works. Students are involved in most major school events.
