<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To inspire and equip students with programming and robotics skills through
hands-on experience, fostering innovative thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving
abilities in real-world scenarios.
<br>
</p>
<h3><strong>Our Vision</strong></h3>
<p>To nurture a community of young robotics enthusiasts who excel in STEM
disciplines and confidently represent the school in national competitions,
while developing essential 21st-century skills.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Aim</strong></h3>
<p>To provide members with opportunities to deepen their understanding of
physics, mechanics, and programming beyond the standard curriculum, encouraging
creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration
<br>
</p>
<h3><strong>Our Programme</strong></h3>
<p>
<br>Over the past many years, the Upper Primary Club members had engaged in
LEGO Mindstorm EV3 and UB Tech Robotics classroom training, learning to
design, build, and program robots for various missions. The Middle Primary
Club members, had been trained in Scratch 3.0, LEGO WeDo 2.0, Microsoft/BBC
Micro:bit, and others. Guided by experienced trainers, students participate
in team-based problem-solving tasks and prepare for competitions like the
National Robotics Programming Competition and other National Hackathon
competitions.</p>
<p></p>

<h3><strong>Current Training programme (2025)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. P3 Robotics Club Members - Block-Based Coding with Scratch 3.0</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Robotics Club offers a foundational training programme in block-based
coding using Scratch 3.0, specially designed for beginners. Through this
programme, students learn to think logically, solve problems creatively,
and develop basic programming concepts in a fun and interactive way.</p>
<p>Over a series of guided sessions, students explore key coding skills such
as sequencing, loops, conditionals, and variables, all while creating animations,
interactive stories, and simple games. They are also introduced to debugging
techniques and collaborative coding practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. P4 &amp; P5 Robotics Club Members - Microsoft Digital Making Roadmap</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our Robotics Club‚Äôs commitment to nurturing future-ready learners,
our Primary 4 and Primary 5 members will embark on the Microsoft Digital
Making Roadmap ‚Äî an engaging programme designed to build computational
thinking and problem-solving skills through hands-on prototyping and the
practical application of design thinking to real-world challenges.</p>
