<h3><strong><u>Green Club 2019</u></strong></h3>
<p>Members contributed actively to the environment and community through
simple acts of green. Pupils will be the ambassadors for a number of initiatives
in support of the 3Rs, energy and water conservation and waste management.
The pupils were engaged through fun and meaningful activities during the
CCA sessions. They were given platforms to share environmental projects
and advocate greening efforts during school and community events. Pupils
were given opportunities to work as a team and be innovative in coming
up with environmental solutions in solving real life issues.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Green Club - World Water Day 2019</u></strong></h3>
<p>In term 1, our Green Club members created prototypes with microbit programming
that can remind people of water-saving habits. On World Water Day 2019,
we witnessed the microbits in action, providing solutions to real-world
problems. We truly believe this process would spur student engagement and
drive coding achievement, which is integral to building 21st century skills</p>

<h3><strong><u>Green Club - Plastic Campaign</u></strong></h3>
<p>WWF conducted a plastic workshop for our green club members. The members
brainstormed various ideas and had&nbsp;a clearer understanding of what
campaigning is about. They also had some campaigning ideas to lead on from
the brainstorming session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students came together to define their project more clearly and set goals
and outcomes. They got into groups to brainstorm ideas about many things
related to plastic waste.&nbsp;Pupils finally decided on having a plastic
challenge in our school. After much brainstorming, they decided to reduce
and refuse the use of straws both in school and out of school.</p>
<p><strong>Pupils brainstorming ideas in groups!</strong>
