### <b><u>Green Club 2019</u></b>

Members contributed actively to the environment and community through simple acts of green. Pupils will be the ambassadors for a number of initiatives in support of the 3Rs, energy and water conservation and waste management. The pupils were engaged through fun and meaningful activities during the CCA sessions. They were given platforms to share environmental projects and advocate greening efforts during school and community events. 
Pupils were given opportunities to work as a team and be innovative in coming up with environmental solutions in solving real life issues.

### <b><u>Green Club - World Water Day 2019</u></b>

In term 1, our Green Club members created prototypes with microbit programming that can remind people of water-saving habits. On World Water Day 2019, we witnessed the microbits in action, providing solutions to real-world problems. We truly believe this process would spur student engagement and drive coding achievement, which is integral to building 21st century skills

Pupils are involved in environmental related programs and activities. Some of the programs and activities are described below.

### <b><u>Environmental Fest 2022</u></b>

The Environmental Science (CCA) launched the Environmental Fest 2022 this year. As part of WWF Eco-Schools program, the CCA members were equipped with skills to change the way they think about waste and adopt a more circular approach of waste management through innovation.

### <b><u>Green Club - Plastic Campaign</u></b>

WWF conducted a plastic workshop for our green club members. The members brainstormed various ideas and had&nbsp;a clearer understanding of what campaigning is about. They also had some campaigning ideas to lead on from the brainstorming session.&nbsp;

Students came together to define their project more clearly and set goals and outcomes. They got into groups to brainstorm ideas about many things related to plastic waste.&nbsp;Pupils finally decided on having a plastic challenge in our school. After much brainstorming, they decided to reduce and refuse the use of straws both in school and out of school.
