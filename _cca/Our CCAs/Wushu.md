<p>Wushu is considered a “performing sport”, consisting elements that are
characteristic to both the sports and performing arts. Wushu is derived
from Chinese martial arts and it teaches “Wu De”（武德）, which is the martial
code of conduct. Learners and practitioners of Wushu are expected to display
excellence in their moral character and to uphold integrity and moral courage
at all times. Wushu improves one’s flexibility, speed, strength, coordination
and endurance. It also instils discipline and respect for others and for
oneself. Unlike any other contact sport, Wushu is considered relatively
safe due to its performance nature. It is gaining popularity nationwide
as more parents and students are coming to recognize the benefits that
learning Wushu could reap, be in terms of health or character development.It
is truly an emerging sport to be enjoyed by all students.</p>
